# GoF Design Pattern Types:

GoF Design Patterns are divided into three categories:

**Creational:** The design patterns that deal with the creation of an object.

**1) Factory:** The factory pattern takes out the responsibility of instantiating a object from the class to a Factory class. <br /> 
**2) Abstract Factory:** Allows us to create a Factory for factory classes. <br />
**3) Builder:** Creating an object step by step and a method to finally get the object instance. <br />
**4) Prototype:** Creating a new object instance from another similar instance and then modify according to our requirements. <br />
**5) Singleton:** The singleton pattern restricts the initialization of a class to ensure that only one instance of the class can be created. <br />

**Structural:** The design patterns in this category deals with the class structure such as Inheritance and Composition.
